# Epic React: What I Learned

Series of summaries on what I learned from going through Kent C. Dodd's react course: Epic React.

As well as sort of a `diary` while doing this course.

=============================================

## Background:

I work as a web developer, for both frontend and backend. But since we have a dedicated backend developer I focus mainly on the frontend and act as a secondary backend developer.

Coming from a Java, Spring Boot, MySQL background, my first project was an admin panel for the execs and board members to view the sales of our API and various other services. That project was built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf (rendered server-side), Hibernate, JPA, and MySQL.

After that project, I have built some other automated tools for our database using Spring Boot, but due to the quick pace nature of a startup company, we realized that we needed to create a platform that better served our B2B customers as well as the B2C customers that we were targeting after.
